Display a side tab that you can easily link to any page. Customize the tab text, font and colors. It's that simple. That's Simple Side Tab.

== Description ==

Add a "Global Call To Action" on your website. Simple Side Tab adds a vertical tab to the left or right side of the browser window that links to any page. The tab stays in place as your visitor scrolls down the page so it's always visible and ready for action. Works great on Mobile too.

Need an effective way to highlight a conversion page? This plugin will help.


= New feature =
* Filter added to modify output of tab text (see FAQ)
* Filter added so the tab display can be turned on and off conditionally (see FAQ)

* Set the text for the tab
* Choose fonts - includes 7 standard screen fonts
* Set the URL your tab links to, internal or external
* Assign the tab to the left or right side of browser window
* Change vertical position of your tab

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are graphics used to display the tab?  =

No. The tab is built with CSS. That way, you can customize the tab text, fonts and colors very easily.

= Can I get the tab to work on the right side of the browser? =

Yes. Now it works on both sides.

= Can you setup multiple tabs with this plugin? =

No. We want to keep it simple so we are only supporting one tab. More than one tab would complicate this plugin quite a bit. Besides, two tabs doesn't look that great on mobile. If you need more than one tab, this plugin is not for you.

= How can I hide the tab from displaying on specific pages? =

Use the `rum_sst_plugin_display_tab` filter to conditionally hide the tab on specific pages. Visit <a href="https://github.com/rumspeed/simple-side-tab/wiki/Code-Snippets:-Display-Tab-Filter" title="Simple Side Tab on GitHub">Code Snippets: Display Tab Filter</a> for code examples.

= How can I conditionally change the tab text? =

Use the `rum_sst_plugin_text_for_tab` filter to modify the output of the tab. Visit <a href="https://github.com/rumspeed/simple-side-tab/wiki/Code-Snippets:-Tab-Text-Filter" title="Simple Side Tab on GitHub">Code Snippets: Tab Text Filter</a> for code examples.

= How can change the CSS classes for the tab? =

Use the `rum_sst_plugin_class_for_tab` filter to modify the output of the tab CSS classes. Visit <a href="https://github.com/rumspeed/simple-side-tab/wiki/Code-Snippets:-Tab-Class-Filter" title="Simple Side Tab on GitHub">Code Snippets: Tab Class Filter</a> for code examples.
